## Breast Cancer Chatbot ‚Äì RAG-based AI Agent --- DESCRIPTION

This project is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users by answering questions related to **breast cancer**. It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach and integrates with **Qdrant**, a vector database for efficient semantic search.

### üîç How It Works

1. **Initial Filtering:**  
   The chatbot first analyzes user input to determine if the question is related to breast cancer.

2. **FAQ Lookup:**  
   If the question is relevant, the agent first tries to answer using pre-curated **Frequently Asked Questions** (FAQ).

3. **General Knowledge Retrieval:**  
   If no answer is found in the FAQ, it searches through broader **domain documents** related to breast cancer.

4. **Fallback to Search Agent:**  
   If nothing is found in the above steps, the system activates a more advanced **search agent** to provide the best possible response.

5. **Answer Storage:**  
   Every valid interaction is logged and stored into the **Knowledge Base (KB)** to continuously improve future responses.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Language & Relevance Detection:**  
   The chatbot detects the user's language and checks if the question is about breast cancer.

2. **FAQ Lookup:**  
   It first tries to answer using a curated FAQ database.

3. **Knowledge Base Search:**  
   If not found in FAQ, it searches a broader knowledge base of breast cancer documents.

4. **Web Search Fallback:**  
   If no relevant answer is found, the chatbot uses a web search agent to find and summarize up-to-date information.

5. **Continuous Learning:**  
   Any answer generated by the web search agent is automatically stored in the knowledge base for future queries.

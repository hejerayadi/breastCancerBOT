# Breast Cancer Support Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI assistant for breast cancer information and support, powered by Qdrant and web search fallback.

## 🧠 Mental Health Support

**Important Mental Health Statement:**

This chatbot is designed to provide information and emotional support for individuals affected by breast cancer. However, it is **NOT a substitute for professional medical or mental health care**.

- 🤝 **Emotional Support**: The chatbot can provide comfort, information, and a listening ear during difficult times
- 🎭 **Emotion Detection**: Real-time emotion analysis from voice and facial expressions to better understand your emotional state
- 💬 **Conversational Support**: Natural conversations to help you feel heard and supported
- 📚 **Educational Resources**: Reliable information about breast cancer to reduce anxiety and uncertainty

**If you're experiencing severe emotional distress, please reach out to:**
- Your healthcare provider
- A licensed mental health professional
- Crisis helplines in your area
- Support groups for breast cancer patients and survivors

**Remember**: You're not alone, and it's okay to seek professional help when needed.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**⚠️ Important: This project requires Python < 11**
- **Recommended**: Python 10.x (personally tested and working)
- **Supported**: Python 3.8 - 3.10
- **Not supported**: Python 11+ (due to compatibility issues with some dependencies)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hejerayadi/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
```

### 2. Check your Python version
```bash
python --version
# Should show Python 3.x.x where x < 11
```

### 3. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: If you encounter any installation errors, try upgrading pip first:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 5. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys and Qdrant URL:

```env
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
QDRANT_URL=https://your-qdrant-url
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
QDRANT_DOCS_COLLECTION=docs_collection
QDRANT_FAQ_COLLECTION=faq_collection
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
```

**Required API Keys:**
- **TOGETHER_API_KEY**: Get from [Together AI](https://together.ai/)
- **QDRANT_URL & QDRANT_API_KEY**: Get from [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)
- **SERPER_API_KEY**: Get from [Serper](https://serper.dev/) (optional, for web search fallback)

### 6. Index your knowledge base (run once, or when KB changes)
```bash
python vectorStore__hajer.py
```

This will create the vector database with your FAQ and knowledge base documents.

### 7. Start the chatbot
```bash
python api.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Language & Relevance Detection:**  
   The chatbot detects the user's language and checks if the question is about breast cancer.

2. **FAQ Lookup:**  
   It first tries to answer using a curated FAQ database.

3. **Knowledge Base Search:**  
   If not found in FAQ, it searches a broader knowledge base of breast cancer documents.

4. **Web Search Fallback:**  
   If no relevant answer is found, the chatbot uses a web search agent to find and summarize up-to-date information.

5. **Continuous Learning:**  
   Any answer generated by the web search agent is automatically stored in the knowledge base for future queries.

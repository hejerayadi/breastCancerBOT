  {
    "question": "CAN I GET A MAMMOGRAM THAT DOESN'T COMPRESS MY BREAST?",
    "answer": "No. There is not a way to perform a mammogram without compression. It is important because it spreads the breast tissue outâ€”which allows your radiologist and your oncologist to see breast details clearly. Compression also reduces the amount of radiation that you receive during a mammogram.",

  {
    "question": "WILL I RECEIVE THE RESULTS OF MY MAMMOGRAM TODAY?",
    "answer": "If you are here for a screening mammogram, you will receive your results in the mail within seven to 10 business days. If you are coming in because you have a problem with your breasts or the radiologist has recommended that you return for a diagnostic mammogram, then the radiologist will speak to you about the results of your tests.",

  },
  {
    "question": "HOW LONG WILL MY MAMMOGRAM APPOINTMENT TAKE?",
    "answer": "A screening mammogram appointment should take about 15 minutes after you have registered. A diagnostic mammogram could take up to an hour after you have registered. If the results from your diagnostic mammogram indicate the need for additional tests, such as an ultrasound or a biopsy, then you could be here for up to three hours.",

  {
    "question": "I HAD MY LAST MAMMOGRAM SOMEWHERE ELSE. DO I NEED TO HAVE MY FILMS SENT HERE?",
    "answer": "Ideally, you'll bring your mammogram with you to your appointment, so we won't have to delay your results. If that isn't possible, we can send for them. Be aware that it can take up to two weeks to receive the films.",

  },
  {
    "question": "WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I GET CALLED BACK FOR A DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM AFTER MY SCREENING MAMMOGRAM?",
    "answer": "Many mammograms indicate abnormal results. Typically, those abnormal results can be clarified or explained with different mammogram views, which better show the breast tissue in question. An ultrasound might also be performed as a follow-up, to ensure no breast cancer cells are found.\nIf those follow-up test results still seem unusual, we can perform breast biopsies to rule out cancer. The majority of breast biopsies are benign. But until we do the evaluation, we won't know whether your unusual mammogram results are due to cancer or something else.",

  },
  {
    "question": "MY PHYSICIAN FOUND A LUMP IN MY BREAST. CAN I COME ANYTIME FOR MY MAMMOGRAM?",
    "answer": "No. You will be scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram on a Monday, Wednesday or Thursday, when there is a radiologist present. This is so the radiologist can view your images and make sure that you have everything that needs to be done for an accurate diagnosis before you leave that day.",

  },
  {
    "question": "WHAT SPECIAL BREAST CANCER TOOLS DO YOU OFFER?",
    "answer": "We have a stereotactic breast biopsy unit. You'll lie down on your stomach, and your breast will go into the hole in the table so the radiologist and technologist can obtain specimens of the area concerned. Compression is used for this procedure in order to maintain stability.",

  },
  {
    "question": "WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE A BREAST EXAM DONE BY MY PHYSICIAN? DOESN'T A MAMMOGRAM SHOW EVERYTHING?",
    "answer": "A breast exam done by a physician can help to detect some types of breast cancer tumors not found with mammography. But clinical breast examinations do have limitations, because very tiny or deeply situated nodules (tumors) cannot always be felt, even by a doctor. The combination of clinical breast exam and mammography is currently recommended as the best approach to early detection of breast cancer.",

  },
  {
    "question": "WHEN SHOULD I HAVE MY FIRST MAMMOGRAM?",
    "answer": "The American Cancer Society recommends that women discuss their mammography screening schedule with their doctors. When women start screening, and how often screening tests are performed, depends on a woman's health, breast cancer risks and preferences.",

  {
    "question": "MY DOCTOR SAID I NEED A SPOT COMPRESSION VIEW. WHAT IS THAT?",
    "answer": "A spot compression view is a specialized picture of a specific area of the breast. The compression paddle is smaller and focused on a specific area of the breast.",

  },
  {
    "question": "A MAMMOGRAM ALWAYS HURTS ME. WHY CAN'T I HAVE AN ULTRASOUND INSTEAD?",
    "answer": "A breast ultrasound is not a breast cancer screening tool. Ultrasound cannot always visualize everything that is seen on a mammogram. Breast ultrasound is used to investigate an abnormality detected by screening or diagnostic mammography or during a physician-performed breast exam.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is a screening mammogram?",
    "answer": "A screening mammogram is an x-ray of the breast used to detect breast changes in women who have no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. With a mammogram it is possible to detect micro-calcifications (tiny deposits of calcium which sometimes are a clue to the presence of breast cancer) or a tumor that cannot be felt.",

  {
    "question": "How often should I get a mammogram?",
    "answer": "If you are 40 or older you should get a mammogram every year. If you are under 40 and have a family history of breast cancer or have other concerns about your personal risk, you should consult a trained medical professional about when to begin getting a mammogram.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why aren't routine mammograms done on women under age 40?",
    "answer": "Pre-menopausal women have dense breast tissue that can make the evaluation of mammograms less sensitive. If a breast abnormality is found during a self-exam or regular physical, an evaluation may include the use of an ultrasound and a mammogram even in women under the age of 40.",

    "question": "What are the potential risk factors that put a woman at higher risk for breast cancer?",
    "answer": "The two most common risk factors are being female and getting older. Other factors that may increase your risk include family history, genetics, and lifestyle factors. It is important to discuss your unique health history with your healthcare provider. It is recommended that women under 40 have an annual clinical breast exam, and women over 40 have an annual clinical breast exam and a mammogram.",

  {
    "question": "As a woman of color are there any specific resources available?",
    "answer": "ALL women should be concerned regardless of their race or ethnicity. Evidence shows that Hispanic/Latina women tend to be diagnosed at later stages and with larger tumors. Although the incidence of breast cancer is slightly lower in African American women, statistics show that mortality or death rates are higher. Our Sisters United in Health initiative is dedicated to health equity and supporting all communities throughout New York state. Our bilingual staff and volunteers are here to help.",

  {
    "question": "I have family members who have had breast cancer. Should I have genetic testing?",
    "answer": "According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer looks for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) genes are the genes most commonly affected in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. If you are of Ashkenazi or Eastern European Jewish ancestry, your doctor might suggest testing for three specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, called founder mutations. These are the most common mutations in people of Ashkenazi or Eastern European Jewish ancestry. The genetic counselor can help you determine the best testing strategy for you and your family. Genetic counseling after genetic testing is important to help you understand your test results and decide the next steps for you and your family.",

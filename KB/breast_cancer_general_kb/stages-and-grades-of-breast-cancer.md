# Stages and grades of breast cancer

The tests and scans you have to diagnose breast cancer give information about:

Knowing the stage and grade helps your doctor plan your treatment.Â

There are different systems used in the UK to stage breast cancer. The most common one is the TNM system. TNM stands for Tumour, Node and Metastasis.Â You might also be told about the number staging system. There are 4 main stages in this system, from 1 to 4.Â

The tests you have also give information about the type of breast cancer you have.

## About breast cancer staging and grades

The stage tells you how big your cancer is and whether it has spread. The grade means how abnormal the cells look under a microscope.

## TNM staging for breast cancer

The TNM system is a way ofÂ staging breast cancer. TNM stands for Tumour, Node, Metastasis.
### Stage 1

- At this early stage, the tumor is small (usually less than 2 cm) and has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
- Treatment is often highly effective, usually involving surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and sometimes radiotherapy or hormone therapy.
- Early detection through screening significantly improves outcomes.

### Stage 2

- The tumor may be larger than Stage 1 (between 2 and 5 cm) and/or may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not distant sites.
- Treatment often includes surgery combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapies, depending on tumor characteristics.
- Regular follow-up is important to monitor for any recurrence.

### Stage 3

- This stage indicates locally advanced breast cancer where the tumor is larger than 5 cm and/or has spread extensively to lymph nodes or surrounding tissues but not to distant organs.
- Treatment is more intensive and may involve a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy.
- Multidisciplinary care and supportive therapies are critical to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Stage 4

- Stage 4, also called metastatic breast cancer, means cancer has spread to distant organs such as bones, lungs, liver, or brain.
- While Stage 4 is generally not curable, many treatments can control the cancer and improve quality of life, sometimes for several years.
- Treatments include systemic therapies like chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted drugs, immunotherapy, and supportive care to manage symptoms.
- Clinical trials may offer access to new therapies.

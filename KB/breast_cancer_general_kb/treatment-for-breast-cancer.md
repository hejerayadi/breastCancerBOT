# Treatment for Breast Cancer

Treatment for breast cancer depends on several factors, including:
- The location and size of the tumor  
- Whether the cancer cells have specific proteins (receptors)  
- Whether the cancer has spread  
- Your general health  

A team of doctors and healthcare professionals will work together to decide the best treatment plan for you.

## Main Treatment Options

Common treatments for breast cancer include:

- **Surgery**  
- **Radiotherapy**  
- **Chemotherapy**  
- **Hormone therapy**  
- **Targeted therapies** (including immunotherapy in some cases)

Your specific treatment plan depends on the type and stage of the cancer.

## Surgery for Breast Cancer

Surgery is often the first step in treating breast cancer. There are different types of surgeries depending on the cancer's size and spread:
- **Lumpectomy**: Removal of the tumor and a small margin of surrounding tissue
- **Mastectomy**: Removal of one or both breasts
- **Lymph node surgery**: To check if cancer has spread to lymph nodes

## Radiotherapy

Radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. It's often given:
- After surgery to eliminate remaining cancer cells  
- To reduce the risk of recurrence  
- Over a few weeks, in short sessions  

---

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy uses cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drugs that travel through the bloodstream to kill cancer cells. It is used:
- Before surgery to shrink the tumor (neoadjuvant therapy)  
- After surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells (adjuvant therapy)  
- To treat cancer that has spread

## Hormone Therapy

Some breast cancers grow in response to hormones like estrogen or progesterone. Hormone therapy can:
- Block the effect of these hormones  
- Reduce hormone levels in the body  
- Common drugs: **Tamoxifen**, **Aromatase inhibitors**

## Targeted and Immunotherapy Drugs

Targeted therapies attack specific features of cancer cells, such as:
- HER2-positive breast cancer (treated with trastuzumab/Herceptin)
- Other genetic markers and mutations

Immunotherapy is used less frequently but is emerging as a treatment for specific subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer.

## Follow-Up After Treatment

After completing treatment, you may have:
- Regular checkups to monitor your recovery  
- Mammograms and imaging tests  
- Support for physical and emotional well-being  
- Open access or patient-initiated follow-up in some hospitals  

---

## If Cancer Returns

Treatment for a recurrence depends on:
- Where the cancer returns  
- Previous treatments used  
- Your current health  
Options may include surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy.

## Treating Symptoms

Even when curing cancer isnâ€™t possible, treatments can help:
- Reduce pain  
- Improve quality of life  
- Manage side effects from cancer or its treatment

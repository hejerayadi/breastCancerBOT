## Fertility and Pregnancy

### Preserving Fertility Before Treatment
- Speak to your oncologist before starting treatment.
- Options:
  - Egg freezing (cryopreservation)
  - Embryo freezing
  - Ovarian tissue preservation
- Hormone therapies might delay safe pregnancy for a few years.

### Breastfeeding and Treatment
- Many cancer treatments are unsafe during breastfeeding.
- You may need to stop breastfeeding before chemo or radiotherapy.
- Consult your oncologist and lactation specialist.

### Cancer During Pregnancy
- Breast cancer during pregnancy is rare but treatable.
- Surgery is generally safe in all trimesters.
- Chemotherapy can be used safely after the 1st trimester.
- Radiation and hormone therapy are typically delayed until after birth.
- Multidisciplinary care (oncology + obstetrics) is essential.

## Sexual Health

### Libido Changes
- Fatigue, pain, hormone changes, and stress can lower sexual desire.
- Communication with your partner is key.
- Lubricants can help with vaginal dryness caused by treatment.
- Don’t rush — intimacy may take time.

### Relationships and Intimacy
- Emotional distance is normal — talk openly with loved ones.
- Physical scars may affect self-image.
- Counseling or couples therapy can help maintain connection and intimacy.

## Menopause and Breast Cancer

### Early Menopause
- Chemo or hormone therapy may trigger early menopause (especially under 45).
- Symptoms: hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness.

### Hormone-Related Effects
- Most breast cancers are hormone-sensitive — so estrogen-based treatments are avoided.
- This limits typical menopause treatments.

### Symptom Relief Options
- **Hot flashes**: dress in layers, avoid caffeine/alcohol, try acupuncture.
- **Vaginal dryness**: use non-hormonal lubricants or moisturizers.
- **Mood swings**: therapy, antidepressants (if needed), support groups.
- Ask about non-hormonal medications to manage symptoms.


## Life After Breast Cancer Surgery

- Adjusting after surgery can be physically and emotionally challenging.  
- Post-surgery support includes physical rehabilitation, scar care, and managing changes in body image.  
- Access to physiotherapy and reconstructive surgery options is improving in Tunisia but may require referrals to specialized centers.  
- Psychological counseling helps many women cope with emotional adjustments.

## Breast Cancer and Menopausal Symptoms

- Some treatments can cause early menopause or menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and sleep disturbances.  
- Managing these symptoms improves quality of life.  
- In Tunisia, herbal remedies are commonly used alongside medical advice, but always discuss treatments with your doctor.

## Lymphoedema After Breast Cancer Treatment

- Lymphoedema, swelling caused by lymph fluid buildup, affects about 1 in 5 women after breast cancer treatment.  
- Early recognition and management are crucial to prevent worsening.  
- Physical therapy, compression garments, and specialized massage (manual lymphatic drainage) are effective treatments.  
- Some Tunisian hospitals and rehabilitation centers now offer lymphoedema clinics, although access may be limited outside major cities.

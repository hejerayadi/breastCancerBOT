## Risk Factors for Breast Cancer

Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer, including:

### 1. Age

- Risk increases as you get older. Most breast cancers are diagnosed in women over 50.

### 2. Family History and Genetics

- Having close relatives (mother, sister, daughter) diagnosed with breast cancer increases your risk.  
- Inherited gene mutations such as **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** significantly raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers.  
- Genetic testing and counseling may be recommended if you have a strong family history.

### 3. Lifestyle Factors

- **Overweight or Obesity**: Excess body fat, especially after menopause, increases risk due to higher estrogen levels.  
- **Alcohol Consumption**: Even moderate drinking is linked to increased breast cancer risk.  
- **Physical Inactivity**: Lack of regular exercise may raise risk.  
- **Diet**: Diets high in processed foods and low in fruits and vegetables may contribute.

### 4. Hormonal Factors

- Early menstruation (before age 12) or late menopause (after age 55) increases lifetime exposure to estrogen and progesterone, raising risk.  
- Having children late or not at all may increase risk.  
- Use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause is linked to a slightly higher risk.

### 5. Other Factors

- Exposure to radiation, especially at a young age.  
- Certain benign breast conditions may slightly raise risk.

## Reducing Your Risk of Breast Cancer

While some risk factors like age and genetics cannot be changed, there are ways to lower your risk:

- Maintain a healthy weight through balanced diet and exercise.  
- Limit alcohol intake.  
- Stay physically active with regular exercise.  
- Avoid or carefully consider the use of hormone replacement therapy.  
- Breastfeed if possible, as it can lower risk.  
- Attend regular breast cancer screenings as recommended.

## Family History and Inherited Genes

- If breast cancer runs in your family, it is important to discuss this with your healthcare provider.  
- Genetic counseling and testing can identify mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.  
- People with these mutations may consider preventive measures, including enhanced screening or preventive surgery.

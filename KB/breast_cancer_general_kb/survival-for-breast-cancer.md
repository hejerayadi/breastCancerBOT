# Survival for Breast Cancer

Survival rates for breast cancer are generally good, especially when diagnosed early. This is largely due to effective screening, early diagnosis, and improved treatments.

Survival depends on many factors unique to each individual, so it is difficult to predict exactly how long someone will live. Your doctor can provide personalized information about your prognosis.
Your doctor can provide personalized information about your outlook (prognosis).

## Survival by Stage

### Stage 1

- Nearly **100%** of women diagnosed at Stage 1 survive for 5 years or more.

### Stage 2

- Approximately **90%** of women diagnosed at Stage 2 survive for 5 years or more.

### Stage 3

- More than **70%** of women diagnosed at Stage 3 survive for 5 years or more.

### Stage 4

- More than **25%** of women diagnosed at Stage 4 survive for 5 years or more.  
- Although Stage 4 breast cancer is not considered curable, treatment may control the disease for some years.

## Overall Survival Statistics

- Survival data is often reported as **net survival**, which estimates survival after accounting for deaths from other causes.  
- The statistics here are based on data from England, for cancers diagnosed between 2016 and 2020, followed up to 2021 (NHS England, Office for National Statistics).

## Factors Affecting Survival

Survival depends on multiple factors, including:

### Cancer-Specific Factors

- **Stage at diagnosis**: Size and spread of tumor. Earlier stages have better prognosis.  
- **Cancer type and grade**: Grade measures how abnormal cancer cells look; higher grade cancers tend to be more aggressive.  
- **Receptor status**: Presence of hormone receptors or HER2 receptors affects treatment options and prognosis.

### Patient-Related Factors

- **Overall health and fitness**: Healthier patients usually tolerate treatment better.  
- **Age and comorbidities**: May influence treatment choices and survival chances.
